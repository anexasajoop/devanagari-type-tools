        This is a small set of tools to easily generate Devanagari test strings and documents that can be useful during typeface design and development.<br/>
     </h1>

     <br/>

     <p>
        <a href="consonant-marks/index.html">Consonants with vowel and other signs</a>
        <br/>
        Use this tool to generate a test string that can list every consonant with every vowel sign (or <i>matra</i>). Optionally, add other signs like <i>candrabindu</i>, <i>anusvara</i> and <i>visarga</i>, as well as the combining mark glyph for <i>reph</i> (Ra + <i>virama</i>) to each combination.
     </p>

     <p>
        <a href="half-forms/index.html">Half forms and biconsonantal conjuncts</a>
        <br/>
        Generate pairs of half forms followed by full consonants by entering the list of consonants whose half forms have been designed and the consonants that you want to test them against.
      </p>
